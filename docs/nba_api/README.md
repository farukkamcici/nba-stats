# NBA API (Third-Party Source) — How We Use It

This folder documents the **third-party NBA data source** we consume via the `nba_api` Python client. These files are **not** documentation of our platform itself; they describe the upstream API and how we should integrate with it.

## Quick Start (How We Use It)
Start with the project-specific guide:
- `integration_manual.md` — consolidated usage + reliability rules + references

## Full Endpoint References
These are generated, upstream-facing references (useful when you need exact params/datasets):
- `api_reference.md` — aggregated endpoint reference (datasets + columns)

## Suggested Reading Order
1) `integration_manual.md`
2) `api_reference.md` (as needed)

## Notes
- The generated docs include a timestamp (e.g., 2026-01-29).
- We are consumers only; our system design docs live in `docs/`.
